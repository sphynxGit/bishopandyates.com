serviceOne: Swap Positioning
serviceOneDesc: A practice whereby an intermediary enters into one side of the swap transaction, such as fixed rate payer (or floating rate payer) to a client who wishes to be a floating rate payer (or a fixed rate payer). Then the intermediary waits for a matching counterparty and offloads the swap thereto. In other words, swap positioning involves holding a portfolio of swaps usually by a swap dealer without seeking to offset each swap with an identical mirror swap.
serviceTwo: Fully Drawn Advance
serviceTwoDesc: Fully drawn advance is a financing method which gives you the freedom to take funds or a loan but only for longer durations. It is an ideal way of financing assets which have a long shelf life such as real estate or a manufacturing plant and equipment, etc.
serviceThree: Balloon Payment
serviceThreeDesc: Balloon payment is the lump sum payment which is attached to a loan, mortgage, or a commercial loan. This payment is usually made towards the end of the loan period. Balloon payment is higher than what you might be paying towards the loan on a monthly basis.

Adequate protection: the analysis of how to protect a household from unforeseen risks. These risks can be divided into the following: liability, property, death, disability, health and long term care. Some of these risks may be self-insurable, while most will require the purchase of an insurance contract. Determining how much insurance to get, at the most cost effective terms requires knowledge of the market for personal insurance. Business owners, professionals, athletes and entertainers require specialized insurance professionals to adequately protect themselves. Since insurance also enjoys some tax benefits, utilizing insurance investment products may be a critical piece of the overall investment planning.
