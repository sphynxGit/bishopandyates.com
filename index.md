serviceOne: Swap Positioning
serviceOneDesc: A practice whereby an intermediary enters into one side of the swap transaction, such as fixed rate payer (or floating rate payer) to a client who wishes to be a floating rate payer (or a fixed rate payer). Then the intermediary waits for a matching counterparty and offloads the swap thereto. In other words, swap positioning involves holding a portfolio of swaps usually by a swap dealer without seeking to offset each swap with an identical mirror swap.
serviceTwo: Cryptocurrency
serviceTwoDesc: A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer of assets. Cryptocurrency is a kind of digital currency, virtual currency or alternative currency. Cryptocurrencies use decentralized control as opposed to centralized electronic money and central banking systems. The decentralized control of each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.
serviceThree: Fully Drawn Advance
serviceThreeDesc: Fully drawn advance is a financing method which gives you the freedom to take funds or a loan but only for longer durations. It is an ideal way of financing assets which have a long shelf life such as real estate or a manufacturing plant and equipment, etc.
serviceFour: Asset Allocation
serviceFourDesc: Asset allocation is an investment strategy that aims to balance risk and reward by apportioning a portfolio's assets according to an individual's goals, risk tolerance and investment horizon. The three main asset classes - equities, fixed-income, and cash and equivalents - have different levels of risk and return, so each will behave differently over time.
